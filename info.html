                This animated video is a kind of ironic parody of digital language assistants with impeccable grammar and accurate word prediction, and a functional style of speech. The work is about a speculative “anti-advertisement” of a fictional online language school that teaches communication on the Internet in a dystopian world where humanity has lost control of its speech and no longer perceives it as its biological organ. Advertising is the promotion of a web plug-in, that is, a "digital language assistant", which is responsible for the user's linguistic activity in the digital space without the user's direct intervention.
